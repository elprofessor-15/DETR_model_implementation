End-to-End Object Detection with DETR

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of the DETR (Detection Transformer) model for object detection, inspired by the research paper “Deformable DETR for End-to-End Object Detection” published in 2023.

Introduction

Object detection has been dominated by region-based convolutional neural networks for years. DETR revolutionizes this approach by introducing a Transformer-based architecture for object detection tasks, eliminating the need for complex hand-crafted pipelines. DETR uses a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions and relies on bipartite matching.

This implementation replicates the techniques discussed in the paper, and fine-tunes the model on custom datasets. The code walks through the steps from data preprocessing, model training, and testing, to generating output predictions.

The repository is based on the paper:
Deformable DETR for End-to-End Object Detection.
The paper proposes a novel approach to end-to-end object detection using transformers, significantly improving detection accuracy and efficiency.

Features

	•	End-to-End Object Detection: Implementation of DETR without using hand-crafted components like region proposals and non-maximum suppression.
	•	Attention Mechanism: Uses multi-head self-attention for global context understanding.
	•	Fine-Tuning on Custom Dataset: The model is fine-tuned on the COCO dataset and tested on custom KITTI images.
	•	Post-Processing: Includes bounding box rescaling, confidence filtering, and visualization of results.
	•	Pretrained Weights: Utilizes pretrained weights on the COCO dataset for fine-tuning and transfer learning.

Model Architecture

The DETR model leverages Transformer-based architecture instead of traditional region proposal networks. The key components of the model include:

	•	CNN Backbone: Extracts image features.
	•	Transformer Encoder-Decoder: The core component that performs object detection.
	•	Set-based Loss Function: Eliminates the need for non-max suppression.

The architecture diagram is consistent with the Transformer models used in natural language processing but adapted for image data with spatial context in mind.
